#### The node js framework that use all opportunities from it!

The main feture is complitely [new routing alghoritm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parisholley/road-runner) that give blazing fast reuest reading.
Also a fiew number of internall calls are reduced load on the RAM and increace response speed.

Another pretty thing â€“ I was inspired of .NET frameworks, so the whole project use TS, and it has strict rules for typing that helps exclude a lot of issues and wrong architecture implementation
